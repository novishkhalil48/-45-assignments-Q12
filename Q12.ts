//12.Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
let prNam = ["Sara", "Amna", "Rida"];
console.log("Hey how are you doing", prNam[0]);
console.log("Hey how are you doing", prNam[1]);
console.log("Hey how are you doing", prNam[2]);
